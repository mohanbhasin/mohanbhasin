## Hello !!👋
Welcome to my GitHub crib! 🚪✨  
My name’s Mohan Bhasin. 
I’m a 20-year-old, currently in my **2nd year**, pursuing a B.Tech degree. 💻

I’m currently learning:
- **JavaScript** 🐍: Trying to make websites do cool things while occasionally crying over `undefined`. 
- **GitHub** 🐙: Figuring out how to commit wisely—both in code and in life. 😄
- **AI** : AI stands for **Always Improvising** (that’s my coding style).

## 🏗️ My GitHub Blueprint
I don't always write clean code, but when I do, it’s usually by accident.
- 🐛 **Bugs?** Yes.  
- ✨ **Features?** Someday.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Progress?** Slow but steady—just like my learning pace.  

## 💡 My GitHub Goals  
1. Write code that actually compiles. 🎯  
2. Collaborate on something cool before the end of this semester. ✨


Thanks for scrolling through my chaotic introduction! 🙌 Remember: Every expert was once a beginner, and every beginner has a README like this. 😅
Peace, bugs, and bytes! ✌️
